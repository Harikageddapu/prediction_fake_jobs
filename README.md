# Fake Job Posting Detection using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Online job portals contain fake job postings that mislead applicants.
This project detects whether a job posting is real or fake using
machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
- Source: EMSCAD / Kaggle
- Size: ~17,000 job postings
- Labels: Real (0) and Fake (1)

## Project Phases
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing & EDA
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Gradient Boosting

## Features
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Text-based classification

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
